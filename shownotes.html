Lorena talks about the idea, mission and details of creating the podcast, steps to take and how it may have not happened. Letting things flow and how information was received and not pushed.  Lucia speaks about the channeled vision of the podcast, how it shows up and how we are just this little speck on the giant maps of lights. All these light connect and create a network.  What goose bumps mean and what kind of sign they are when you feel/ get them. Lorena goes into listening to her calling and pushing past comfort zone, starting level 2 of Akashic Records and how sometimes there isn't time for the change. Lorena speaks about her reading with Kristos Perry (Interview with Kristos & Foster Perry, episode 18). Purpose, listening to self and the messages you are getting. Finding your tool, what works for you, and how different things work for different people.  Changing jobs and the transition phase, and the uncomfortable moments. How you may feel comfortable where you are and you may want to not leave or leave cause of boredom. we speak about growth, expanding and cutting bad things our and putting good things in slowly.

        <h1>Episode 15 - Being Present - being present with loved ones and ourselves, how to disconnect from distractions and how it's affecting our relationships and spiritual path</h1><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk about being present in our lives and our relationships, as well as how being present affects our spirituality and our growth. In this day and age with so much technology, our work and life balance, connecting with family members and general day to day living it's hard to find balance and be present with ourselves, let alone others in our lives. We go into what we struggle with and what being present means to us.<br><br>
        What being present means to each of us. Being present in meditation is "easy", but not so easy in our daily life and daily tasks. Our thoughts get in the way of what we are doing later (our mental to do list). Multi-tasking and how this can take us away from being present. Anxiety/panic attacks/fear equates to not being present a lot of the time. Pay attention to this and realize you may feel this way when Lorena's experience with her Reiki level 2 and master attunement. How not being present can affect our relationships and the quality of relationships (family, friends, partners, work, etc..). How to deal with other people in your life not being present, our experiences. Being present with ourselves. What we do to help ourselves be more present with ourselves and the people around us. Distractions & multi-tasking. Some people need to deal with working from home, lack of time, being present and also putting up boundaries. With the Akashic Records readings we need to be so present as readers, and this has pushed us to seek more presence and being in the moment. Being present can make us feel calm,grounded, joyful, aligned. Sometimes we need to put up boundaries with people in order to be more present in our lives (messages, telephone, etc). Reiki and meditation are practices Lorena finds helpful in becoming more present and relaxing in her life. Be mindful of what you are consuming on social media, TV, etc. Filter out what no doesn't serve you and be careful with comparing yourself to others.<br><br>

        <h1>Episode 14 - Curiosity - how curiosity is linked to our higher self & intuition, and how we can use curiosity to grow spiritually & personally</h1><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk about curiosity and how it has served us to grow and learn about ourselves. Curiosity can be seen sometimes as intuition, pings, callings, etc. Our curiosity something is lost as we grow up and learn certain patterns and conditioning from our family and people around us. We need curiosity in this life so we can grow. When we feel called to things, we don't let fear and certain ideas set in and take us away from what could potentially be our true path.<br><br>
        A special gift for some lucky listeners. Lucia's and her Angelic Healing path. What Lorena's angelic healing session experience. Children and curiosity, how curiosity is so fundamental in growing and becoming who they need to be. Fear holding us back from ideas, travelling, changes and sometimes even trying something new. Curiosity helps us learn more about ourselves, learn more about the world around us, allows us to come out of our comfort zone, expand our world, it can help us see things differently and ultimately discovery ourselves and who we are in the world. How we can sometimes hold ourselves back in so many ways due to fear and not follow our curiosity. Our generation is so much more spiritually awakened and aware of their higher self and we are loving differently. We can be multi-passionate and that's ok, everything we learn can bring us to the next great thing in our lives.<br><br>

        <h1>Episode 13 - Ego - what it is, how it plays a role in our day to day & spiritual lives and how to keep it in check</h1><br>
        In this episode we talk all about the ego and how this plays a role in our lives and how this affects our spiritual path and enlightenment. We don't want to ignore the ego because in some ways it is there to protect us, but on the other hand we don't want it blocking us from growing and following our true path. Here are some things we go into during the episode:<br><br>
        The ego is here to help us disconnect from our higher selves, so we don't remember past lives. The ego and the Akashic Records. How the ego blocks you from connecting to the Akashic Records. The ego is part of our lives, it's a duality we deal with and need to learn from. The ego is what makes you feel disconnected, it pushes us away from our real authenticity. How to identify the ego - it's the "me me me" character inside of us, taking things personal, feeling hurt, not forgiving, etc. Tips on how to connect to yourself and feel the difference of ego and love in your body. Reading your body and emotions is important. Tune into yourself (thoughts, emotions, feelings, etc). The ego needs to be put aside with any spiritual work and healing. We need to use pure love and put yourself first with the spiritual healing first to have the capability of helping others from love. The ego is protection in a way, but we need to dig deeper and push past this superficial/protective layer so we can progress and heal. Balancing the ego - not controlling the ego. Stop and look inward and recognise the ego. Where do your desires come from? Ego or Love? Take inventory of yourself and find out where the reactions & desires are coming from.<br><br>

        <h1>Episode 12 - Spiritual Partnership - our journey with spirituality and spiritual partnerships and relationships</h1><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk all about spiritual partnerships, which are friends, family, colleagues or any relationship in your life. How we feel and see spirituality in our own lives, what we have seen through the Akashic Records, what friends have dealt with on their spiritual paths, etc. We wanted to create this episode to let you know you are not alone and that we all go through our own struggles with spirituality, but sometimes you can feel alone, and this goes to show that it's normal. We also go into the following:<br><br>
        What spirituality is for each of us. What it means and what it has meant for us in each of our lives. Spirituality is different for everyone, but in general is connecting to ourselves, looking inward, and feeling connected to everyone and everything. Lucia's struggle with feeling so connected to herself and everything, and having that need to connect with people around her in the same way, but not everyone is ready for this. Seeing family or friends "struggling" with issues and not being able to help as they are not connected or open to this way of seeing things. Spirituality and paths are so different, so respecting everyone's individual path, journey and decisions is important. How different countries we lived in helped us expand, or in some cases close off to being ourselves and our spirituality. What do you do when people aren't there yet (spiritual path)? You need to find people to connect to, to be able to expand and learn. In this day and age you can connect to people from all over the world, you don't need to be in the same country. Use Facebook, Instagram and even podcasts to connect to like minded people and share ideas, you don't have to feel alone. The Soul Tribe Podcast was about getting ideas to people, and helping people, and accepting ourselves and what we believe. Sharing your gift and your truth is important. Don't hide who you are and this will help call in the right people in your life. Self improvement and spirituality can impact not just ourselves but people around us.<br><br>

        <h1>Episode 11 - Self Love and Self Care - How does this look for each of us and our struggles and changes throughout life</h1><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk about what self love and self care means to us and our struggles that we find a lot of people around us also go through on their spiritual path. See notes below:<br><br>
        For lucia self care/love means taking time for meditation (quieting the mind) which turns out it's also a moment for channeling messages from her masters and guides. She received great information for herself and her family, it's like and Akashic records reading for herself. Meditation means she is checking in with herself.<br><br>
        For Lucia working out also is included in the self care & self love ritual. Working out to feel good, feel like she can move better and she loves herself more. It helps her with her mind when she runs, to process feelings and feel like she can get through things better. Working out to help connect to herself, her body and mind at the same time.<br><br>
        For Lorena this is kundalini yoga where she can let emotions out, this gives her space to let things out and get the emotions out. It's an hour and a half of allowing yourself to let stuff out and giving yourself time to breathe. The act of physical breathing allows for processing emotions and thoughts. As well journaling in the morning is self love and meditation in the morning, these are vital to start the day right. Having time to herself and being with herself, maybe doing something for herself in that time as well. Just being with herself.<br><br>
        For Lorena exercising wasn't always about self love, it was more about looking a certain way. Now moving her body/working out is about making time for herself. She hasn’t been following a program, it's more about listening to her body and what feels right on the day. It's doing things that are good for your body and feels good. It's about being gentle with yourself.<br><br>
        Self love is listening to yourself, being compassionate with yourself, not pressuring yourself to show up in a certain way.  Strip away all the layers and really prioritize yourself and your wellbeing (spiritual, mental, physical).<br><br>
        Be gentle with yourself.<br><br>
        Get outside of the structure/obligations and listen to yourself and what feels right for you.<br><br>
        Enjoy what you are doing and be in the moment. Don't always do things for an outcome, do it for the enjoyment.<br><br>
        For Lucia after having kids it was hard for her to accept her body. She kept working out and enjoying it, letting go of the pressure of looking a certain way and by doing this she workout out more often and really enjoyed it. She tries to eat healthy and moving her body for herself.<br><br>
        Self love after the pregnancy was a struggle and took Lucia a long time to get to where she is now. Accepting herself and feeling ok with herself. The before and after pictures that everyone is showing of their post baby weight/body us a lot of times unrealistic and gives us unhealthy goals to work for.<br><br>
        The more pressure we put on ourselves with self care and self love it just makes things harder.<br><br>
        Everyone's body is different and we can't expect unrealistic things from ourselves. We need to be honest with ourselves.<br><br>
        Being a new mom and taking care of yourself (self love) is so hard and for Lucia this was when she had the hardest time with self love and looking after herself.<br><br>
        Being a new mom really does test your self love, it's hard enough finding time for yourself but when you needs are put to the side, even harder.<br><br>
        Sometimes you don't need an hour, you just need a few minutes to just breathe.
        Self love is a journey. When Lorena started loving herself more there was a huge shift of saying no to a lot of things that didn't align, respecting herself more and realizing that what other people think doesn't matter as much as being true to yourself.<br><br>
        Saying no to things is important, putting up your boundaries and respecting yourself.<br><br>
        When you start living authentically things in your life start shifting, people come in and out of your life and things feel different.<br><br>
        Spending time with yourself and doing things you love as opposed to doing things out of FOMO or because you can't say no in case people won't like you anymore.<br><br>
        Letting go of people that maybe don't serve you and don't align with you is big. When we shift and change everything starts changing. People will come in and out and that's ok.<br><br>
        When Lorena started loving herself she now feels like she can lean on herself and she doesn't need other people to be there for her all the time like before. She can be there for herself and be compassionate with herself.<br><br>
        Lucia felt very out of place, left out and put to the side when she became vegan. She felt angry with people about it, she felt hurt since she felt left out.<br><br>
        How Lucia and Lorena feel about drinking and being around certain situations. How we need to put up boundaries, but also respect people and their journey. The struggles with alcohol and how there doesn't seem to be a medium at times.<br><br>
        Self love sometimes starts with getting in tune with your spiritual path and tuning into your higher self.<br><br>
        Putting up boundaries with people is important in self love, just as important as saying no to things that don't align with you.<br><br>
        Communication and saying how you feel is self love.<br><br>
        Be patient with yourself in your self love journey. Work on each element that comes up, your "weaknesses" and strengthen what needs to be lifted.<br><br>
        Be there for yourself before you are there for everyone else. Listen to yourself and how you feel.<br><br>
        Trust that if you are living authentically that things will fall into place. If you are always living from a place of self love, being authentic and being yourself things will work out. Trusting the process and trusting yourself to guide you in the right direction. Being patient is important on this journey, especially with yourself. Don't force things. Figure out who you are. Be you!<br><br>

        <h1>Episode 10 - Forgiveness - How forgiveness comes up in the Akashic Records and why it's so important to forgive</h1><br>
        <p>Why does forgiveness come up in readings? Sometimes it's due to you not haven forgiven or sometimes it's due to someone not forgiving you. Maybe you felt wronged, or you feel like you aren't getting an apology from someone you felt wronged you. But everyone's journey is so different that the other person might not even know they wronged you. <br><br>
        Not forgiving is blocking you from your spiritual path, from your contract.<br><br>
        Not forgiving is going to hinder YOUR progress, it's going to affect YOU as the main character of YOUR life.<br><br>
        When you get your Akashic Records book open during a reading the information is for YOU. It's not about letting people off the hook, or downplaying any behaviour or situations/circumstances, or that the other person isn't going to karmically deal with what they did to you. That's not what the Akashic Records is worried about. The Akashic Records is concerned about you forgiving and you to move on with your life and purpose, with your divine plan.<br><br>
        Sometimes it's about forgiving yourself due to guilt or ideas we have.<br><br>
        There are 2 parts to it: Forgiving others for yourself and forgiving yourself for yourself.<br><br>
        You need to let go in order to grow and move forward in a healthy way.<br><br>
        Forgiveness isn't about the other person/party asking for forgiveness, it's about us detaching from the situation, expectations and letting it go.<br><br>
        You need to forgive to be free. Don't expect other people to assist you in the process of forgiveness, this sets us free.<br><br>
        Dealing with issues is like peeling an onion, it's about healing and taking off the layers. One thing will lead to the next lesson, karmic lesson. Sometimes old things will come back, but maybe you need to deal with this "old issue" at a deeper level.<br><br>
        Pay attention to the words we speak, this can give us so much insight into the issues we are dealing with. Why are we constantly bringing things up time and time again? Is it because we haven't healed it? <br><br>
        If you are asking about something specific with a situation it's probably because you haven't let it go.<br><br>
        Listen to yourself, deep down we know if we have forgiven or not.<br><br>
        Our egos can play a big role in blocking us from our spiritual paths and forgive.<br><br>
        You need to do the healing in order to let go and forgive.<br><br>
        What happens if we don't let go of things and we don't forgive?<br><br>
        The wake up call! This can come in many forms - illness, accidents, etc <br><br>
        Wake up calls come into your life linked to forgiveness many times as an illness or sickness.<br><br>
        What happens when the body holds onto something that shouldn't be there? Like anger, remorse, resentment, sadness, etc. If you are holding on to all this and not forgiving and not letting go, this will turn into sickness.<br><br>
        The organ that is a huge reflector of the issue that the non-forgiveness is connected to. Illness many times is avoidable, especially with forgiveness.<br><br>
        Love yourself enough to let go of the pain, move on and enjoy your life and follow with your divine plan.<br><br>
        Many times the other person is not in our lives (for different reasons) and we will never get an apology. We cannot depend on the other person to begin the process of healing, this is in our hands.<br><br>
        Sometimes we associate with our stories, the pain and the hurt and the non-forgiveness. We have the power to detach from this and let go, be free!<br><br>
        The ego is all about ME, I am the main character and everything happens to me. The Ego is what doesn't allow us to let go and forgive.<br><br>
        It's about stepping out of being a victim and being free.<br><br>
        The Akashic Records can provide you with answers to situations so you can let it go. You can get an explanation as to why certain things have happened "to you", and with this, you may feel like you can step out of that place of being a victim. It takes you out of the ego.<br><br>
        It's you who will be with yourself the rest of your life. The other person isn't there and doesn't have to be a part of this life you have, you are the only one that will suffer if you don't let go and forgive.<br><br>
        Give yourself the love the other individual might not have given you. Be nice to yourself, love yourself.<br><br>
        Forgive so that you can create the world and life you love want and deserve.<br><br>
        It's about breaking cycles and moving forward to to create what we want.<br><br>
        Living a high vibrational life and feeling free starts with being honest with ourselves, allowing feelings to come up so we can process them and forgiving.<br><br>
        Have patience and compassion for yourself. Things in your life will start shifting, people will come in and out, we will attract love and balance. Things will be on a higher vibration and we will live in flow.<br><br>
        This episode is based on our own experience from Akashic Records readers and personal experiences. We are not therapists. If you feel like you need help please seek it in whatever way you feel is right for you.<br><br>

        <h1>9. Cellular Memory - How Cellular Memory is linked to the Akashic Records and healing</h1><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk about Cellular Memory and how this can come up in Akashic Record readings. In the Akashic Records cellular memory comes up as trauma, fear and anxiety (or other ways). You may have heard of cellular memory through people's stories of organ transplants, for example a heart transplant makes someone feel different and gives them different emotions. Cellular memory is a big part of the Akashic Records and readings in general.<br><br>
        Sometimes you may have certain feelings you don't understand and when you can't pinpoint where they come from (you don't have any trauma you can find), then it could be cellular memory playing a role in this. The cells in your body remember things in your life, trauma, fear, anxiety, if these feelings are strong enough this could be something your ancestors went though or felt. It's now part of your DNA, and you have a memory of trauma that might not be yours, it could have been given to you by another family member. Things from our ancestors can block us in this life, it's something to keep in mind in your healing journey.<br><br>
        Our job in this life is to pinpoint where things are coming from, understand why we are feeling certain ways, heal it and let it go...move forward in a healthy way. These feelings can be anything from fear, anxiety, limiting beliefs, etc. We can question ourselves and try to understand what is triggering us and figure out why we are getting so overwhelmed. Finding the root can help us manage situations in another way. Is it something you inherited, a repeating family pattern, is it something you started believing due to something that happened to you, is it something from another family member (mom/dad) or maybe it is a past life. Cellular memory adds another layer to our self discovery and healing. We are here now to break patterns, heal! We share some personal stories and examples in this episode, which we hope help you break this down in your own life and maybe help you see things in another light.<br><br>
        In this episode we also share some personal experiences we hope help you identify some patterns in your life that may be linked to cellular memory. Hopefully the examples help you in some way.<br><br>

        <h1>8. Meditation, Mindfulness and Self Work</h1><br>
        <p>This episode is all about meditation and mindfulness techniques/methods we can use for our own self work and self awareness. It's so important to take time to be with yourself and take care of yourself, whatever that means to you.<br><br>
        <b>SEE SHOW DETAILS BELOW:</b><br><br>
        Meditation - Different things work for different people, how meditation can help with self love and you can make this part of you self care routine (your you time).<br><br>
        Having a busy schedule and fitting in meditation and self work (self-care). Figure out what works for your schedule and your life. Some people it works best in the morning, or maybe you need to find a slot of time in the afternoon or even in the evening after work/before bed.<br><br>
        Finding space sometimes is hard. Noise and people around you may never go away or die down so you need to figure out how to make it work under whatever circumstances you have. Put on some headphones and drown out noise with some meditation music, binaural beats or music with a specific Hrz to heal different things.<br><br>
        Lorena: self reiki and meditation works for me at night now, since in the morning she doesn’t have time.<br><br>
        Lucia: Meditation works at night before sleeping since she has time to herself, the house is quiet and she really has time to herself.<br><br>
        Intentional meditation - Connecting to higher post of self and bringing down light that I want to heal or work on. Ask for what is lacking or what I need, to see certain things, to lower anxiety. Every color will bring something different to you and your body. Journal on what you feel you need to work on and make it a point to intentionally work on this when you meditate.<br><br>
        Book: Communing with the Divine: A Clairvoyant's Guide to Angels, Archangels, and the Spiritual Hierarchy (Barbara Y. Martin and Dimitri Moraitis). Link to book on Amazon here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Communing-Divine-Clairvoyants-Archangels-Spiritual/dp/0399167749/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=QXKH61Y691X20V4YNV30">book</a><br><br>
        Book: Change Your Aura, Change Your Life: A Step-by-Step Guide to Unfolding Your Spiritual Power (Barbara Y. Martin and Dimitri Moraitis). Link to book on Amazon here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Aura-Step-Step/dp/110198306X">book</a><br><br>
        Change Your Aura, Change Your Life - Lucia mentions this book when she talks about her intentional meditation, she uses this book to help her with the meditation.<br><br>
        Intentional meditation for Lorena is her Reiki: she envisions high energy and healing. Reiki helps calm her mind down.<br><br>
        Mindfulness meditation: sitting with yourself and observing thoughts and letting them go. Not judging your thoughts and just observe. Sometimes Lorena would meditate and envision what she would want or need, like fully loving herself and living the life she wants. This would help her shift her thinking and make her day start positive.<br><br>
        Your morning routine or night routine shouldn't predict the outcome of your day, more so enhance it and help you make space for yourself and calming your mind and letting emotions pop up if needed.<br><br>
        Meditation helps ground you and tune into yourself.<br><br>
        <b>TIPS FOR SELF WORK AND MEDITATION:</b><br><br>
        (we are not experts but we wanted to provide some tips that have worked for us and our lives)
        Start slow and don't pressuring yourself. If you miss a day don't beat yourself up. Don't make it an obligation, make it enjoyable. Start slow and gradually. Start feeling the benefits and allow it to progressively build up to a routine. Allow it to become part of your day without it dictating your day. It can be something you look forward to and crave but if you miss a day, it's ok! You want something that will work long term, so start slow.<br><br>
        Treat the meditation or time as your you time. It's a spiritual and mental pampering for your self. It's important to have time to yourself. Meditation can help you ground yourself. Create a positive association and maybe put it into your schedule. Treat it like a time/moment that you are taking care of yourself. If meditation doesn't work for you, it could be anything that works for you and makes you feel grounded and connected. Meditation can also be a great time to receive intuitive messages. Lucia finds herself channeling information about herself and family members during her meditation and connecting to her higher self. It's a time you are connecting to yourself. You can feel things and allow emotions to come up.<br><br>
        Schedule when best works for you. Morning, afternoon, evening...whatever works best for you. Lorena works best in the morning, for Lucia it works best in the evening before bed. Be realistic and schedule the time that works best for you. In any case make sure you aren't rushed and that you have the space.<br><br>
        Don't go full on right away. Slow increments of time will help you stay consistent. Slowly add time onto your meditations and mindfulness practice. Be realistic! 45 minutes when you are starting won't work and might not help you stay consistent. Consistency is key, just like with fitness and nutrition. To see benefits you need to be consistent and even just doing 5 minutes a day for awhile will help. Guided meditations on Youtube or apps can help, there is a beginning and an end, so use those if those help at first. 10-20 minute meditations are amazing and you get the benefits. Find what works for you and do that, even if it's 5 minutes.<br><br>

        <h1>2. Why we started The Soul Tribe Podcast and what it's about</h1><br><br>
        <p>In this episode we talk about why we started a podcast and what the podcast subjects will be about.<br>
        This project started with Lorena getting a message to start a podcast with Lucia about the Akashic Records and spirituality. They were already talking about these things over the phone and in person, and they wanted to share these conversations with other people that would be interested or benefits from it. With some research and a lot of planning they made this project come to life.<br><br>
        This podcast is about the Akashic Records and SO MUCH MORE! It's about opening our minds to seeing things in a new way, seeing new opportunities to grow and to learn. We hope you enjoy the information, guests, insight and openness! Thank you for joining us on this journey.<br><br>
